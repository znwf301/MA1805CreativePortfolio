Why hello there and welcome to my awesome README File.
Within this zip file are 5 folders corresponding to the prompt that have been asked of us to make: Collisions, Drawing, Media, Movement, Multiple

-- Collisions --
For collisions, I decided to make a "collect to stay alive game". It was inspired by the last level in Sonic 3&K (S3&K) doomsday zone where sonic has to collect rings to maintain his hyper form. Within my P5.js, I used sprites from S3&K for the background, ring and player character. S3&K doomsday is my favourite sonic genesis final stage. The music and the atmosphere screams urgency.

-- Drawing --
For this, I completed the prompts that were presented. Not very amazing but they allowed me to understand the basics of how to script with P5.js and were a lot of fun to wrap my head around.

-- Media --
This was a struggle for me as I had already incorporated media into most of my prompts (This was the last prompt I completed), so i decided to do something simple and silly to really just have fun and share that energy. There isn't really any theme behind it. It is just me messing around with audio and images.

-- Movement --
I used an array to create the same effect as a camera exposed to high radiation (gamma particles specifically) over the Demon core incident recreation photo along with the Geiger counter sfx to really sell the shear terror the men during the incident felt despite the clean enviorment they were all in.

-- Multiple --
Took my quite a while to design but I recreated Windows 7/xp paint software (or really a lower level version) using P5.js. It was time consuming but I was and still am very happy with the way it turned out. I was even surprised that I was the one that made it.
